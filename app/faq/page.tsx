    question: "What is Arabic calligraphy?",
    answer:
      "Arabic calligraphy is the artistic practice of handwriting and calligraphy based on the Arabic alphabet. It is known in Arabic as 'khatt' (خط), derived from the word 'line', 'design', or 'construction'. Arabic calligraphy is highly regarded in Islamic culture and has developed over centuries into various styles and forms.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many styles of Arabic calligraphy exist?",
    answer:
      "There are six major classical styles of Arabic calligraphy: Naskh, Thuluth, Diwani, Kufi, Riq'a, and Nastaliq. Each has distinct characteristics and uses. Naskh is commonly used for body text, Thuluth for decorative purposes, Kufi for architectural decoration, Diwani for official documents, Riq'a for everyday writing, and Nastaliq is popular in Persian and Urdu calligraphy. Our generator helps you explore some of these styles, particularly Kufic and others suitable for digital representation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Kashida in Arabic typography?",
    answer:
      "Kashida (كشيدة), also known as tatweel, is a typographic feature in Arabic writing that involves elongating certain characters by inserting a straight line between connected letters. It's used for text justification, aesthetic enhancement, and emphasis. Our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> allows you to adjust Kashida length to create more elegant text arrangements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I use your Arabic calligraphy generator?",
    answer:
      "Using our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> is simple: 1) Enter your Arabic text in the input field, 2) Select from various calligraphy styles and fonts, 3) Adjust size, color, and spacing options, 4) Preview your calligraphy in real-time, and 5) Download your creation as PNG, SVG, or PDF. The tool works directly in your browser without requiring any downloads or installations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the generated calligraphy commercially?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All calligraphy created with our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> is free for both personal and commercial use. You retain full rights to your creations. However, please note that while the generated output is yours to use freely, the underlying fonts may have their own licensing terms for direct distribution.",
  },
  {
    question: "What formats can I download my calligraphy in?",
    answer:
      "Our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> supports multiple export formats: PNG (for web use and printing), SVG (scalable vector format ideal for logos and designs), and PDF (perfect for documents and high-quality printing). Each format has its advantages depending on your intended use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why doesn't my Arabic text display correctly?",
    answer:
      "If Arabic text isn't displaying correctly in our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong>, try these solutions: 1) Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge), 2) Check that your text is properly formatted Arabic script, 3) Verify your device supports Arabic fonts, and 4) Try refreshing the page. Most display issues are resolved by using an updated browser.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I save my work to continue later?",
    answer:
      "Currently, our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> doesn't include user accounts or cloud saving. However, you can bookmark specific designs by copying the URL when you're working on a piece, as the parameters are saved in the link. We recommend downloading your work as you create it to ensure you don't lose your designs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Arabic fonts are available in the generator?",
    answer:
      "Our <strong>Arabic calligraphy generator</strong> includes a carefully curated selection of Arabic fonts covering major calligraphy styles including modern interpretations of Kufic, Naskh-inspired fonts, decorative styles, and contemporary Arabic typefaces. Each font is optimized for digital display and includes proper Arabic text shaping and ligatures.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why doesn't my downloaded image match what I see in the preview?",
    answer:
      "This could happen for several reasons: 1) Some browsers may render Arabic text differently than others, 2) The export process might not capture certain advanced CSS effects perfectly, or 3) Custom fonts might not be properly embedded in the exported file. For best results with our <strong>arabic calligraphy generator</strong>, we recommend using the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox, and if you need a perfect reproduction, consider taking a screenshot or using the SVG export option.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I learn Arabic calligraphy beyond using this generator?",
    answer:
      "While our <strong>arabic calligraphy generator</strong> is great for creating digital calligraphy, learning traditional Arabic calligraphy requires practice with proper tools. We recommend: 1) Taking courses from certified calligraphers, 2) Starting with basic letter forms in the Naskh style, 3) Practicing with traditional reed pens (qalam) and ink, 4) Studying historical manuscripts, and 5) Following our blog for tutorials and resources. Check our <a href='/blog/beginners-guide-to-calligraphy' class='text-amber-600 hover:underline'>Beginner's Guide to Arabic Calligraphy</a> for more information.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I fix Arabic text appearing disconnected or reversed (outside the generator)?",
    answer:
      "If Arabic letters appear disconnected or in the wrong order when using text outside of our <strong>arabic calligraphy generator</strong> (e.g., in other software), make sure: 1) You've set the text direction to right-to-left (RTL) using the 'dir=\"rtl\"' attribute or software setting, 2) You're using a proper Arabic font that supports letter connections, 3) Your system has proper Arabic language support installed. Our generator handles these settings automatically within its preview.",
